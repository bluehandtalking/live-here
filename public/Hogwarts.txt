Although technically a university, Hogwarts is home to so many students,academics, staff, ghosts and magical beings year-round that most consider it a city inits own right. What it lacks in conventional city living, it more than makes up forwith its tight-knit community and endless mysteries. The climate is mild, if a bit onthe drizzly side, and the landscape has a mellow pastoral beauty. For those who aresafety-conscious, Hogwarts may not be the best choice; there is currently an activecriminal element in the area, the Death Eaters led by Volde-? He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named. This leads to a high incidence of deaths of mysterious ?accidents?, althoughsometimes the apparent perpetrators may surprise their neighbors. An intenselyacademic inclination doesn't diminish the fun: it's mostly magical! Thoseconsidering a move to Hogwarts have to accept the risks it presents, but who wantsto die a plain old Muggle, anyway? And it'll take a village to remove the gangproblem. Hearts dreaming of magic, adventure, heroism and a worthy cause willfind themselves fulfilled and happy here - as long as they aren't dead or cursed.
