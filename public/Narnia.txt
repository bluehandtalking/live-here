Trapped in an eternal winter (although it's never Christmas, sadly),Narnia's climate is not for the faint of heart. Nor is its crime rate; war, assassination, and magical curses are the norm. As for politics, Narnia finds itself bent to the will of a brutal dictator. Narnia is the perfect home for those whose hearts yearn for a life of adventure, though, and whose dreams are filled with magic and heroism. Rife with opportunities for those brave enough to seize them, it?s a place of natural beauty and supernatural mystery. Narnians dream of liberation ? and a fearless leader, pure of heart, to make that dream a reality. For the animal lover, rumors abound of talking fauna dwelling in secret and fleeing persecution, eager to return under the gaze of a benevolent new administration.  And who knows? That frigid climate might just change if someone defeated Jadis, the White Witch currently in power.
