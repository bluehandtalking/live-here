Located in Northern Minnesota, Duluth is a city of about 85,000 residents.Endowed with characteristic Midwestern hospitality and charm, it offers residents awelcoming community with a rich colonial history. Several institutions of higherlearning, including the Duluth campus of the University of Minnesota, call this placehome. Its far northern location offers residents a four-seasonal climate notable forits severe winters. Those winters, though, may offer birding enthusiasts a rare sightin the lower forty-eight: gyrfalcons wintering over in Duluth's harbor, the so-calledseaport of the Midwest.
