A largely unknown spot, Grinnell is a town of about 10,000 in the heart ofIowa. Its secret lies in its eponymous college; Grinnell College brings a fascinatingmix of domestic and international students and professors into the midst of ahumble, welcoming Midwestern town. A town so safe you can still leave your laptopunattended for 20 minutes in a cafe while you pop to the post office, Grinnell alsooffers excellent opportunities for education at all levels, a classic continentalclimate, and an array of world-class speakers, musicians, concerts, lecturers, andcelebrity appearances, many open for free to the public.
