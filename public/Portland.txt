Often regarded as Seattle's baby sister, Portland embodies much of thesame charm a younger Seattle offered. Quirky and diverse, Portland’s temperateclimate makes pursuits such as biking, gardening, and hiking accessible year-round.Dog-friendly, liberal, laid-back, and friendly, Portland also boasts a fantastic variety of local businesses, craft microbrews, ironic hipsters, and great restaurants. Beautiful forests, plentiful bike lanes, good skiing, a dramatic Pacific coastline, and most of the benefits with a lesser degree of frenetic energy than San Francisco or Seattle are just a few reasons that 600,000 Portlanders are proud of the town they call home.
