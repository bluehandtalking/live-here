Approximately 300,000 residents call Anchorage home, making it thelargest North American community above the 60th parallel. Tax-friendly andremote,  Anchorage offers unparalleled access to the rugged beauty of the far North.The climate is harsh, but Anchorage hosts a stable economy based mostly on military,governmental, tourist, and extractable resource interests. A politically conservativestate, Alaska is nonetheless home to many left-wing outdoor enthusiasts because ofits stunning and unusual scenery, flora, and fauna. Winters are long and dark,summers short and endlessly bright, but for those who love Alaska, Anchorage is asgood a place as any to call home.
