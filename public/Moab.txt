Small Moab, Utah is any mountain biker's dream. A hot, arid climate in theAmerican Southwest make it ideal not just for bicyclists, but also for canoeists,backpackers, whitewater rafters and more. The economy is driven primarily bytourism, but Moab is an undeniably beautiful locale that can hardly be beaten for itsvariety of year-round warm-weather outdoor recreational opportunities. Warmenough for year-round outdoor recreating, and boasting such locales as ArchesNational Park, Moab can fairly be called the outdoorsman's gateway to theAmerican Southwest, as its 5,000 lucky residents and countless jealous touristscould tell anyone who cared to ask.
