There's no such thing as heaven on earth, but if you squint just a little, Konamight fool those who love all things warm, sunny, beachy, and tropical. Any of its200,000 residents could list the reasons they love it there, but they hardly need toexplain why. Like all of Hawaii, the pace of life is slow and the prevailing demeanor laid-back. Located on hardened lava flows from volcanic eruptions past,Kona boasts an annual Ironman triathlon, historical sites, national parks, locally-grown coffee, fresh fruit and seafood, proximity to everything else Hawaiian, and of course world-class beaches. Its island location guarantees a high cost of living and limited career opportunities (outside the tourism industry, that is), but for those who can afford it or who are willing to make lifestyle adjustments, Kona might just be the most perfect place on earth.
