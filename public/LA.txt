The city of glitter, glitz, and glam, LA is not for those seeking a low-key retreat ora slow pace of life. Although income disparity can make for a tense atmosphere,especially when it comes to race relations, LA nonetheless has a lot to offer. A world-famous food scene, frequent celeb sightings, a sunny and warm year-round climate,and the dream of fame draw many to LA. Prices are sky-high, and traffic is awful, butmany (3.9 million residents that is!) say the shopping, dining, strong economy, andoverall glamour of LA, not to mention abundant opportunities in the cinema andmusic industries, more than make up for it.
