Ah, New Orleans. Best known, perhaps, for Hurricane Katrina and Mardi Gras, New Orleans continues to rebuild itself from its watery ashes. The storm and its aftermath lowered the population to 370,000 but it continues to slowly grow. From nationally recognized universities to parties on Bourbon Street, from world-class food to an unexpectedly large Asian community, New Orleans is a city of music, energy, delicious food, hot weather, an unusual cultural bent toward the macabre and mysterious, parties, and of course a staggering wealth of American plantation history. Its sleepy, mellow inclinations in no way detract from the intensity of New Orlean?s party, music and dining scenes. Not for the dedicated wilderness lover or the driven entrepreneur, New Orleans is the perfect home for a humanitarian wanting to contribute in a real way to his/her community, a lover of food or history, or someone wanting a slower pace of life without giving up one iota of party intensity. Just don't let the tourists overwhelm you!
