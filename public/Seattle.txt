Originally a sleepy emerald gem in America's northwestern corner, Seattlehas become not just a hub for technological and aerospace innovation but also ahotbed of entrepreneurial energy. Despite its economic strength and wealth of jobopportunities, Seattle has remained a laid-back city of around 650,000 (with manymore in the surrounding suburbs). Gore-Tex and Tevas with socks are acceptable inall but the fanciest of restaurants, cyclists are prevalent, and geeky culturalreferences abound. Not unlike its southern sibling, Portland, Seattle is fiercelyliberal, pet-friendly, and jammed with local enterprise, great food and localbreweries, distilleries, and vintners aplenty. Just outside the city lie some of thegreatest remaining wilderness areas in continental America: the Cascade Mountains,San Juan Islands, and the Olympic Peninsula. Skiing, hiking, backpacking, rafting,kayaking, climbing, mountain biking and more are common hobbies, and Seattle alsoboasts easy access to Vancouver, BC, Canada.
