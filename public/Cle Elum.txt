Tiny Cle Elum, a community of fewer than 2,000, nestles in the CascadeMountains just east of Seattle. It offers an unparalleled wealth of outdooractivities, including camping, hiking, and river rafting. An overall moderate climate features cool winters and warm summers, but avoids severe extremes in either. Its jobopportunities are limited, but its recreational opportunities abound. For such asmall town, not unlike Leavenworth, Cle Elum packs a big punch in terms of what itcan offer the person seeking a more intimate community with noteworthy recreational resources.
