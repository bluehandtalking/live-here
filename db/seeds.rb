  {name: "Moab", rating: "A", description: "Small Moab, Utah is any mountain biker's dream. A hot, arid climate in the American Southwest make it ideal not just for bicyclists, but also for canoeists, backpackers, whitewater rafters and more. The economy is driven primarily by tourism, but Moab is an undeniably beautiful locale that can hardly be beaten for its variety of year-round warm-weather outdoor recreational opportunities. Warm enough for year-round outdoor recreating, and boasting such locales as Arches National Park, Moab can fairly be called the outdoorsman's gateway to the American Southwest, as its 5,000 lucky residents and countless jealous tourists could tell anyone who cared to ask."},
  {name: "Kona", rating: "A", description: "There's no such thing as heaven on earth, but if you squint just a little, Kona might fool those who love all things warm, sunny, beachy, and tropical. Any of its 200,000 residents could list the reasons they love it there, but they hardly need to explain why. Like all of Hawaii, the pace of life is slow and the prevailing demeanor laid-back. Located on hardened lava flows from volcanic eruptions past, Kona boasts an annual Ironman triathlon, historical sites, national parks, locally-grown coffee, fresh fruit and seafood, proximity to everything else Hawaiian, and of course world-class beaches. Its island location guarantees a high cost of living and limited career opportunities (outside the tourism industry, that is), but for those who can afford it or who are willing to make lifestyle adjustments, Kona might just be the most perfect place on earth."},
  {name: "New Orleans", rating: "A", description: "Ah, New Orleans. Best known, perhaps, for Hurricane Katrina and Mardi Gras, New Orleans continues to rebuild itself from its watery ashes. The storm and its aftermath lowered the population to 370,000 but it continues to slowly grow. From nationally recognized universities to parties on Bourbon Street, from world-class food to an unexpectedly large Asian community, New Orleans is a city of music, energy, delicious food, hot weather, an unusual cultural bent toward the macabre and mysterious, parties, and of course a staggering wealth of American plantation history. Its sleepy, mellow inclinations in no way detract from the intensity of New Orlean?s party, music and dining scenes. Not for the dedicated wilderness lover or the driven entrepreneur, New Orleans is the perfect home for a humanitarian wanting to contribute in a real way to his/her community, a lover of food or history, or someone wanting a slower pace of life without giving up one iota of party intensity. Just don't let the tourists overwhelm you!"},
  {name: "Portland", rating: "B", description: "Often regarded as Seattle's baby sister, Portland embodies much of the same charm a younger Seattle offered. Quirky and diverse, Portland√ïs temperate climate makes pursuits such as biking, gardening, and hiking accessible year-round. Dog-friendly, liberal, laid-back, and friendly, Portland also boasts a fantastic variety of local businesses, craft microbrews, ironic hipsters, and great restaurants. Beautiful forests, plentiful bike lanes, good skiing, a dramatic Pacific coastline, and most of the benefits with a lesser degree of frenetic energy than San Francisco or Seattle are just a few reasons that 600,000 Portlanders are proud of the town they call home."},
  {name: "Cle Elum", rating: "B", description: "Tiny Cle Elum, a community of fewer than 2,000, nestles in the Cascade Mountains just east of Seattle. It offers an unparalleled wealth of outdoor activities, including camping, hiking, and river rafting. An overall moderate climate features cool winters and warm summers, but avoids severe extremes in either. Its job opportunities are limited, but its recreational opportunities abound. For such a small town, not unlike Leavenworth, Cle Elum packs a big punch in terms of what it can offer the person seeking a more intimate community with noteworthy recreational resources."},
  {name: "Grinnell", rating: "B", description: "A largely unknown spot, Grinnell is a town of about 10,000 in the heart of Iowa. Its secret lies in its eponymous college; Grinnell College brings a fascinating mix of domestic and international students and professors into the midst of a humble, welcoming Midwestern town. A town so safe you can still leave your laptop unattended for 20 minutes in a cafe while you pop to the post office, Grinnell also offers excellent opportunities for education at all levels, a classic continental climate, and an array of world-class speakers, musicians, concerts, lecturers, and celebrity appearances, many open for free to the public."},
  {name: "Duluth", rating: "C", description: "Located in Northern Minnesota, Duluth is a city of about 85,000 residents. Endowed with characteristic Midwestern hospitality and charm, it offers residents a welcoming community with a rich colonial history. Several institutions of higher learning, including the Duluth campus of the University of Minnesota, call this place home. Its far northern location offers residents a four-seasonal climate notable for its severe winters. Those winters, though, may offer birding enthusiasts a rare sight in the lower forty-eight: gyrfalcons wintering over in Duluth's harbor, the so-called seaport of the Midwest."},
  {name: "Anchorage", rating: "C", description: "Approximately 300,000 residents call Anchorage home, making it the largest North American community above the 60th parallel. Tax-friendly and remote,  Anchorage offers unparalleled access to the rugged beauty of the far North. The climate is harsh, but Anchorage hosts a stable economy based mostly on military, governmental, tourist, and extractable resource interests. A politically conservative state, Alaska is nonetheless home to many left-wing outdoor enthusiasts because of its stunning and unusual scenery, flora, and fauna. Winters are long and dark, summers short and endlessly bright, but for those who love Alaska, Anchorage is as good a place as any to call home."},
  {name: "Los Angeles", rating: "C", description: "The city of glitter, glitz, and glam, LA is not for those seeking a low-key retreat or a slow pace of life. Although income disparity can make for a tense atmosphere, especially when it comes to race relations, LA nonetheless has a lot to offer. A world-famous food scene, frequent celeb sightings, a sunny and warm year-round climate, and the dream of fame draw many to LA. Prices are sky-high, and traffic is awful, but many (3.9 million residents that is!) say the shopping, dining, strong economy, and overall glamour of LA, not to mention abundant opportunities in the cinema and music industries, more than make up for it."},
  {name: "Hogwarts", rating: "B", description: "Although technically a university, Hogwarts is home to so many students, academics, staff, ghosts and magical beings year-round that most consider it a city in its own right. What it lacks in conventional city living, it more than makes up for with its tight-knit community and endless mysteries. The climate is mild, if a bit on the drizzly side, and the landscape has a mellow pastoral beauty. For those who are safety-conscious, Hogwarts may not be the best choice; there is currently an active criminal element in the area, the Death Eaters led by Volde-? He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named. This leads to a high incidence of deaths of mysterious ?accidents?, although sometimes the apparent perpetrators may surprise their neighbors. An intensely academic inclination doesn't diminish the fun: it's mostly magical! Those considering a move to Hogwarts have to accept the risks it presents, but who wants to die a plain old Muggle, anyway? And it'll take a village to remove the gang problem. Hearts dreaming of magic, adventure, heroism and a worthy cause will find themselves fulfilled and happy here - as long as they aren't dead or cursed."},
  {name: "Narnia", rating: "C", description: "Trapped in an eternal winter (although it's never Christmas, sadly), Narnia's climate is not for the faint of heart. Nor is its crime rate; war, assassination, and magical curses are the norm. As for politics, Narnia finds itself bent to the will of a brutal dictator. Narnia is the perfect home for those whose hearts yearn for a life of adventure, though, and whose dreams are filled with magic and heroism. Rife with opportunities for those brave enough to seize them, it?s a place of natural beauty and supernatural mystery. Narnians dream of liberation ? and a fearless leader, pure of heart, to make that dream a reality. For the animal lover, rumors abound of talking fauna dwelling in secret and fleeing persecution, eager to return under the gaze of a benevolent new administration.  And who knows? That frigid climate might just change if someone defeated Jadis, the White Witch currently in power."}
